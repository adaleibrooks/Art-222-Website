<b> <p>Southworth Planetarium - Project 1</p> </b>

<p> Ideas:<ul>
<li> I want to use usm colors somewhere in the logo and stick to those colors and complementary colors </li>
<li> Earth with a sash that has its name on it </li>
<li> The sash would be USM yellow and the writing on Southworth would be USM blue
Movement would be portrayed here
<li> I want there to be some overlapping of shapes</li>
<li> A telescope that looks at space with the name written on the side</li>
</ul>
Goals: <ul>
<li>For people to know that it is a planetarium without the word in the logo. The only text to be Southworth so that it stands out from other planetariums.</li>
<li>Something simple yet effective</li>
<li>For the logo to attract more people to the planetarium</li>
</ul>
Concept:<ul>
<li>My artwork answers the question of what Southworth is </li>
<li>What type of events are held there </li>
<li>What school Southworth is at </li> <p>
</ul>

<b> <p>Cryptid - Project 2</p> </b>

<p> Ideas:<ul>
<li>For my cryptid I wanted it to look like a dinosaur or something that you would have no possibility of seeing in real life. 
I wanted my cryptid to by shy and lurk in shadows and water. I also wanted the audience to be curious about it but also respectful because due to the unknown of the cryptid.
</ul>
Goals: <ul>
<li> I wanted my proposed piece to work by merging multiple real life animals together to create a cryptid with the features listed above. The story that goes along with my cryptid will also help viewers question its existence and help them understand how it acts.
</ul>
Concept:<ul>
<li> My inspiration for my cryptid is flying squirrels and chameleons (specifically the one from frozen 2). I want my cryptid to question what animals exist in our deep forests/jungles and what happens when multiple animals become one? What traits does it inherent? Is it better suited for its environment? 
</ul>

<b> <p>Video - Project 3</p> </b>
<p> Ideas:<ul>
<li> The cartoon world and the real world do not share many similarities. Cartoons are often hyperbolic/exaggerated of things that might happen in the real world. This is why I wanted to try to combine some aspects of both into one video clip. I ended up choosing Mr.Rogers as the “real life” world because his show is all about kindness and loving each other. I chose Woody the Woodpecker for my cartoon because he is a troublemaker and needs to learn some lessons from Mr.Rogers. In the beginning of the clip Woody is getting in trouble with a police officer for speeding. I edited this part to also make him seem loud and annoying by using a train horn found in Mr.Rogers. As Woody speeds away, it turns into Mr.Rogers to allude to Woody running into the “real world”; I used audio cuts to put Woody in this clip. The trolly in Mr.Roger runs into a roadblock, another trolley, and is now stuck. I reversed the same clip to make it go back into the tunnel. Though Woody is not visually seen in this world I wanted to make it seem like he also got stuck and had to go back to his world, as if he was on the trolley. When Woody gets back to his world the police officer is mad and Woody dances over to kiss him on his head. I wanted this clip to play after the Mr.Rogers scene to make it seem like Woody learned how to love when he was in Mr.Rogers world. </li> 
</ul>
Goals: <ul>
<li> What I wanted the audience to take away from the experience is that even the worst or most annoying people can learn and grow. There was political issues that were also connected to my piece and helped contextualize it. A cartoon police officer is shown in the Woody the Woodpecker clip who gives tickets to speeders. This is something that happens in our world and the topic of police officers is a highly debated topic. So this connection helped contextualize my piece.</li>
</ul>
Concpet: <ul>
<li> The montage strategies of Woody the Woodpecker and Mr.Rogers are very similar, they both use a lot of Jump cuts, fading in and out, J cuts, and L cuts. I wanted to include some of these editing techniques in my final composition to make it seem like it could be a real clip from the show. Even though in the original clip of Woody the Woodpecker he was kissing the head of the police officer to be annoying, I wanted to twist the interpretation of the clip. Essentially inverting the meaning behind the scene and what influenced his action.</li>
</ul>

<b> <p>Projector - Project 4</p> </b>

<p> Ideas:<ul>
<li> I wanted my projector project to be a video or images of a glacier melting over time. The touch sensor would be used to start the video and the harder you press the faster the glaciers melt and the screen turns back. If you let go of the sensor the glacier would slowly start to reform. If you press too hard for too long I want the screen to just go black, like the world has died. I also want to use the level feature in TouchDesigner to make the video go black/get darker when you press the sensor harder, almost like you are killing it.</li>
</ul>
Goals: <ul>
<li> Though I do not know the technical terms for what I want to use, I know that I want to use a touch sensor, levels, and reverse/speed. By using the tools in TouchDesigner I hope to clearly convey my concept and make the audience question their role in it. </li>
</ul>
Concept:<ul>
<li> I want my piece to explore the irreversible damage that we have caused on the world. When we step somewhere we are not supposed to, interfere with a natural cycle, overuse resources, etc, we are causing damage. A way to visualise this damage is through photos and videos of things like glaciers and reefs. I want the audience to question their role in this changing glacier and think about what they can do to help it. I have seen works like this before that inspired my piece. When I visited Iceland over the summer, for a climate change focused class, we visited the Perlan museum. This museum is a national history museum that has a whole section about glaciers and how they are being destroyed. Specifically, there was this table that if you spun it you could see the glaciers melt on map and would flash red when you reached 2050. There are also other works that I have seen throughout my life that have inspired me since there are many artists out there doing the same type of work.  <p>
