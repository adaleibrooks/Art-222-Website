<b> <p>Southworth Planetarium - Project 1</p> </b>

<p> Ideas:<ul>
<li> I want to use usm colors somewhere in the logo and stick to those colors and complementary colors </li>
<li> Earth with a sash that has its name on it </li>
<li> The sash would be USM yellow and the writing on Southworth would be USM blue
Movement would be portrayed here
<li> I want there to be some overlapping of shapes</li>
<li> A telescope that looks at space with the name written on the side</li>
</ul>
Goals: <ul>
<li>For people to know that it is a planetarium without the word in the logo. The only text to be Southworth so that it stands out from other planetariums.</li>
<li>Something simple yet effective</li>
<li>For the logo to attract more people to the planetarium</li>
</ul>
Concept:<ul>
<li>My artwork answers the question of what Southworth is </li>
<li>What type of events are held there </li>
<li>What school Southworth is at </li> <p>
</ul>

<b> <p>Cryptid - Project 2</p> </b>

<p> Ideas:<ul>
<li>For my cryptid I wanted it to look like a dinosaur or something that you would have no possibility of seeing in real life. 
I wanted my cryptid to by shy and lurk in shadows and water. I also wanted the audience to be curious about it but also respectful because due to the unknown of the cryptid.
</ul>
Goals: <ul>
<li> I wanted my proposed piece to work by merging multiple real life animals together to create a cryptid with the features listed above. The story that goes along with my cryptid will also help viewers question its existence and help them understand how it acts.
</ul>
Concept:<ul>
<li> My inspiration for my cryptid is flying squirrels and chameleons (specifically the one from frozen 2). I want my cryptid to question what animals exist in our deep forests/jungles and what happens when multiple animals become one? What traits does it inherent? Is it better suited for its environment? 
</ul>
